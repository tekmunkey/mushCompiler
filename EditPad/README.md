# EditPad

I use EditPad Pro v6.7.1 for Windows.  I honestly have little idea whether these Custom Syntax and File Navigator definitions will work with older versions, or with current versions of the EditPad Lite edition.

I do know that EditPad Pro is affordable with a one-time purchase pricetag and is hands-down the best text editor for Windows that I've found for literally anything.  It does CRLF or LF-only line terminations for specific filetypes, does lineterm conversions inplace, does text-encoding conversion inplace, and a whole lot more.  You can even switch from text to hexadecimal view with a hotkey tap.  I have to use other hex editors for files bigger than 4gb and for opening raw disk drives.  Big whoop.

I'd rather use EditPad Pro than MS Word or Visual Studio even for the stuff those things are designed for.  About the only thing it doesn't do well is support hotkeys for building and pipe compiler output back in for debugging purposes.  The makers of EditPad provide me with the tools to make my own custom syntax highlighting and syntax navigation/folding definitions (although I've found that all I really need with exploded MUSH Softcode is to let EditPad fold code according to my indents).

Using these EditPad modifications I've built and my mushCompiler, I effectively have a full-featured MUSH Code IDE.  Just add the MUSH or MUX Platform of your choice.
