# mushCompiler
Saying that we 'compile' MUSH softcode is inaccurate, but this thing actually does include many of the features found in real compilers.  

Among these features are include files, named and scoped variables, compiler-stripped and compiler-passed (distribution) comments, and pre-processor directives designed to facilitate MUSH Softcoding regardless of your chosen MUSH platform.  

In addition to converting exploded-format MUSH softcode into MU/SH/X parse-able lines which you can easily upload via a client's input->send function, this product also rapidly reformats ASCII Art and escapes troublesome characters into a format you can send straight into a MUSH or MUX for that quality look and feel players love.
